The goal of this exercise was to get comfortable with Python syntax and practice basic programming logic by creating a simple algorithm that prints a multiplication table. Since I'm already somewhat familiar with other programming languages, I decided to challenge myself a bit. I created a more flexible version of the table where the user can choose the range of numbers to multiply from 1 to 10. The user can also decide whether to define a specific end point or stick with the default value of 10. I'm willing to improve my code, so don't expect this to be the definitive project.
